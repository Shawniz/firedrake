====================
Installing Firedrake
====================


Supported systems
=================

A :ref:`native installation<pip_install_firedrake>` of Firedrake is officially
supported on Ubuntu and macOS though it should be installable on any Linux
distribution. Windows users are encouraged to use WSL_ or one of Firedrake's
:ref:`alternative installation mechanisms<alternative_install>`.


.. _pip_install_firedrake
Installing Firedrake using pip
==============================

A native installation of Firedrake is accomplished in 3 steps:

#. :ref:`Install system dependencies<install_system_dependencies>`
#. :ref:`Install PETSc<install_petsc>`
#. :ref:`Install Firedrake<install_firedrake>`


.. _prerequisites
Prerequisites
-------------

On Linux the only prerequisite needed to install Firedrake is a suitable version
of Python (3.10 or greater). On macOS it is important that homebrew_ is installed
and that the homebrew-installed Python is used instead of the system one.


.. _firedrake_configure
firedrake-configure
-------------------

To simplify the installation process, Firedrake provides a utility script called
``firedrake-configure``. This script can be downloaded by executing::

  $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake/master/scripts/firedrake-configure


.. _firedrake_archs
Prepared configurations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``firedrake-configure`` provides a number of different possible configurations
(termed 'ARCH's) that specify how PETSc is configured and which external
packages are built. The currently supported ARCHs are:

* ``default``: the default installation, suitable for most users
* ``complex``: an installation where PETSc is configured using complex numbers

The different configurations can be selected by passing the flag ``--arch`` to
``firedrake-configure``. For example::

  $ python3 firedrake-configure --show-system-packages --arch complex


.. _install_system_dependencies:
Installing system dependencies
------------------------------

If on Ubuntu or macOS, system dependencies can be installed with
``firedrake-configure``. On Ubuntu run::

  $ sudo apt install $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-system-packages)

which will install the following packages:

.. literalinclude:: apt_deps.txt

If on macOS you should instead run::

  $ brew install $(python3 firedrake-configure --show-system-packages)

which will install the following packages:

.. literalinclude:: homebrew_deps.txt

If you do not have one of these systems then these dependencies will need to
be installed manually.

.. note::
   Not all the system dependencies declared by ``firedrake-configure`` have to
   be installed at this stage. Some (e.g. HDF5, hwloc) can also be installed
   from source by PETSc during the ``configure`` :ref:`step<install_petsc>` by passing
   ``--download-hdf5`` or similar.


.. _install_petsc:

Installing PETSc
----------------

For Firedrake to work as expected, it is important that a specific version of PETSc_
is installed with a specific set of external packages. To install PETSc you need to
do the following steps:

#. Clone the PETSc repository::

   $ git clone https://github.com/firedrakeproject/petsc.git
   $ cd petsc

#. Run PETSc ``configure``, passing in the flags generated by ``firedrake-configure``::

   $ ./configure $(python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options)

#. Compile PETSc::

   $ make

If you are using one of the
:ref:`officially supported distributions<supported_systems>` then these configure
options will include paths to system packages so PETSc can correctly find and
link against them. If you are not, then you should pass the ``--no-package-manager``
flag to obtain a set of configure options where ``firedrake-configure``
pessimistically assumes that no external packages are available, and hence need
to be downloaded and compiled from source::

   $ ./configure $(python3 ../firedrake-configure --no-package-manager --show-petsc-configure-options)


Customising the PETSc installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since ``firedrake-configure`` only outputs a string of options it is straightforward
to make changes to the options passed to PETSc ``configure``. You can either:

* Append additional options when ``configure`` is invoked::

   $ ./configure $(python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options) --download-exotic-package

* Write the output of ``firedrake-configure`` to a file than can be modified::

   $ python3 ../firedrake-configure --show-petsc-configure-options > my_configure_options.txt
   <edit my_configure_options.txt>
   $ ./configure $(cat my_configure_options.txt)


.. _install_firedrake:

Installing Firedrake
--------------------

**env

With these environment variables set, Firedrake can now simply be installed with
the command::

pip install --no-binary h5py git+https://github.com/firedrakeproject/firedrake.git

*** note petsc4py cache, also mpi4py and h5py

.. note::
   During the installation Firedrake will compile and install petsc4py_. If
   you have previously installed petsc4py on your computer with a different
   PETSc then ``pip`` will erroneously reuse the existing petsc4py which is 
   linked against the wrong library. To avoid this you need to run the
   command::

       pip cache remove petsc4py

   Equivalent commands may also be necessary for mpi4py and h5py if you are
   changing the MPI and/or HDF5 libraries in use.


Checking the installation
-------------------------

We recommend that you run some simple tests after installation to check
that Firedrake is fully functional. Activate the venv_ as above and
then run::

  cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/src/firedrake
  make check

This command will run a few of the unit tests, which exercise a good
chunk of the functionality of the library. These tests should take a
minute or less. If they fail to run for any reason, please see the
section below on how to diagnose and debug a failed installation.


Updating Firedrake
------------------

TODO


.. _alternative_install
Alternative installation methods
================================

As well as being installable through ``pip``, Firedrake also provides
`Docker containers<https://hub.docker.com/u/firedrakeproject>`_ and
Jupyter notebooks running on :ref:`Google Colab<google_colab>`.
