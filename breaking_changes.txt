* op2.{MIN,MAX} are now op3.{MIN,MAX}_WRITE (as opposed to {MIN,MAX}_RW).
* op2.Global, op2.Dat and op2.Mat are no longer used. Instead prefer op3.HierarchicalArray
  and op3.PetscMat etc. The former types were considered to be too "mesh specific" and
  brought no value to the abstraction.

* Homolya2016 and McRae2016 have been removed as citations because I edited the code
  and don't know where to put them.
